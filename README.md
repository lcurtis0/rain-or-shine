I want the client to have a proper marketing website that always can be easily edited at a moments notice.

Now the client should be able to check weather, tempture, wind speed, and humidity in any city U.S. city.

I learned that inorder to apis have certain parameters, one must gain data from another api and query strings must be added to adjust that data. This is inreference to gaining latitude and longitude from a city location.
